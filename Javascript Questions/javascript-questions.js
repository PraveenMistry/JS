Within the function, we first declare the name variable with the var keyword.

Variables with the let keyword (and const) are hoisted, but unlike var, don't get initialized. 
They are not accessible before the line we declare (initialize) them. This is called the "temporal dead zone". 
When we try to access the variables before they are declared, JavaScript throws a ReferenceError.

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language: we don't specify what types certain variables are. 
Values can automatically be converted into another type without you knowing, which is called implicit type coercion. 
Coercion is converting from one type into another.

In this example, JavaScript converts the number 1 into a string, in order for the function to make sense and return a value. 
During the addition of a numeric type (1) and a string type ('2'), the number is treated as a string. 
We can concatenate strings like "Hello" + "World", so what's happening here is "1" + "2" which returns "12".
